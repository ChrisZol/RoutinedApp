# Flutter Notes



## Setup



| Flutter                                                      | Angular                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Downloading Flutter SDK (over 2GB disk space necessary)      | Required Tools: Node.js, Code Editor/IDE, Terminal           |
| For web development, Google Chrome is the prefered browser to be used | Easy installing of Ionic CLI with NPM                        |
| IDE: Flutter Plugin available for Android Studio and IntelliJ, VS Code and EmacsFor this project, VS Code will be used | Creation of first project possible with Ionic CLI 'ionic start' -> Sample Projects available to get started, Starting project 'ionic serve' |
| Getting started: Step by step guide, detailed documenation and tutorials | Getting started: Step by step introduction of application development with an example project (Photo Gallery), Using Capacitor for cross platform development (Installing package via NPM), PWA Elements (NPM) |
| Setting up the application: Flutter CLI provides commands which set up flutter sample projects of choice (with all necessary dependancies) |                                                              |




## Development



| Flutter                                                      | Angular                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Easy switch between end devices (browser, Android/IOS Emulators,...) in the VS Code IDE possible |                                                              |

| During runtime, hot reloads of code changes are supported -> Great developer experience, Time saving, Supports experimental coding (high learning curve) | Automatic hot reload when code changes occur                 |
| Works with an easy to understand Widget structure            | Works with a component structure                             |
